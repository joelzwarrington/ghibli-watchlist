# Building clean React, with custom hooks ðŸŽ£

This project's purpose is to demonstrate the effectiveness of custom hooks. It's recommended you follow my accompanying [blog post](https://dev.to/joelzwarrington).

## Getting started

To first get started with the example, you'll want to pull down the branch `introduction` and run `npm start`, the app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running tests

Any application should have automated testing so that you're confident when releasing to production and this project is no different. To run the test suite, run `npm run test`.
